# WB-Hackathon
Weights and Biases sponsored hackathon for UCLA ACM, 30 min to create the best emotion classifier

A lot of the code was provided by Weights and Biases for evaluating differences between their code and vanilla pytorch. However, as this was a competition, much tweaking went on and the best code was run by myself, though I do not claim full ownership of this code.
